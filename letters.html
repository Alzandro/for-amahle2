                <p>My Dearest Love,</p>

                <p>
                    Every day with you feels like something written by fate itself.
                    Your laugh, your warmth, the way you make the world slow down for me —
                    it's everything I never knew I needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I choose you. In every lifetime. In every version of me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Forever yours,<br>
                    Your Valentine 💕

                <p>
                    If I could bottle the way you make me feel,
                    I'd carry it everywhere just to remind myself
                    how lucky I am to be loved by you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You are my peace, my fire, my home.

                    We have met in a world full of chaos, in a environment
                    full of chaos but in each other's presence, we have
                    brought each other peace and calmness in the midst of chaos.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You are my calm in the storm, my light in the darkness, and my anchor in the chaos.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Baby you have given me a high no substance could take me
                    (yes I've only done 3 in my life, keeping it that way😆)
                </p>

                <p>
                    You are my drug, my addiction, my high. I never want to come down from this feeling of being in love with you.
                </p>

                    Every moment spent with you, I cherish and live for more,
                    whether it is through the phone or in person. I have not once
                    felt bored or tired being around you.

                    Let's forget about the past, and learn from it. Let's forget about
                    the future, and just plan for it. Let's forget about the present, and just live in it.
                    With you, I have everything I need and more. Different from the past, better for my future
                    and a gift to my today.
                </p>

                    No one can replace my lifetime being spent with you.

                <p>
                    We are like Allie and Noah from The Notebook. We're the 365 letters I
                    never stopped writing. Even when life gets loud or we're in different chapters,
                    my heart is always addressed to you. We're the kind of couple that doesm't 
                    just "work" we fight for it. We're that stubborn, "it's not going to be
                    easy" kind of love that Noah promised. You're my 17 year old dream and my 80 year old reality.
                    Even if i lost everything else, I'd still find my way back to you. You're the story
                    I'll never get tired of telling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You are my forever, my always, and the love that makes every day worth living.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yours truly till the end,<br>
                    Alzandro ❤️
